# Obsidian MOC to Manuscript Plugin

This plugin converts your currently open MOC into a manuscript draft by replacing any linked notes with their text. The resulting manuscript is saved to the root of your vault for you to continue processing.

Inspired by this note about keeping manuscript outlines while you research: https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Create_speculative_outlines_while_you_write
